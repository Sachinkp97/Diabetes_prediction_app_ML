# Diabetes prediction application using Python

This application is made using [sklearn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scikit-learn) Machine Learning libraries and [pyqt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) for its graphical UI. 

Support Vector Machine classifies input data with 80% accuracy. [PIMA Indians diabetes dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/diabetes) from the UCI archive is used to train the model.
